* It ****simplifies the configuration**** and ****setup process , allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their application.****
* ****Is open-source Java Framework used to create a Micro service.****
* Is developed by ****Pivotal Team****, and it ****provides a faster way to set up And an easier, configuration, run both simple and web-based application.****
* It is combination of ****Spring Framework**** and ****Embedded servers.****
* ****Main goal of Spring Boot**** is ****Reduce Development, Unit Test, Integration test time**** and in Spring Boot ****there is no requirement for XML Configuration.****
* Spring Boot is spring module that provide the ****RAD**** ****(Rapid Application Development)**** ****Feature**** to the ****SF****. ****/**** ****It means we can fastly Create.****
* It is used to ****stand-alon** spring-based** ****application****  ****that you can just run becuse it needs minimal spring configuration.****
  
*The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.*
*A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.*


    ****Spring + Embedded     _      XML<bean>     =    Spring  
  framework****  ****HTTP             configuration      Boot****
                      ****SERVER     or @ confi****

  
1.*It ****makes speed fast in development speedup development / It make 80% of configuration automaticlly.*****
  
2.*****Opinionated Default- Automatically Configure**** (****It provide too much things in default. We cam changed accordingly / But It helps then we cannot change them.**** )*

3.*It is ****scan the class path**** and ****find the dependency it will automatically configure the things.*****


****Advantages****
1. it ****create stand-alon spring application**** that can be started using ****JAVA-JAR(file)****
2. ****Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)****
3. Provide ****Opinionated starter depencies**** to simplify you ****build configuration****
4. ****Automatically configure**** ****spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible.****
5. Provide ****production-ready features**** such as ****metrics, health checks and externalized cofiguration****
6. ****Absolutely no code generation**** and ****no requirement for XML configuration.****
   
****Starter POP**** Is basically a ****project object model**** so basically we know Maven a little use here.

*All dependencies we add that start with=*
****Spring-boot-starter-web****


*If we have to put JP , then here we have*  ****spring-boot-starter-data-jpa****

 *there is no hard limit to the dependencies.*
